COMPONENTS OF GRAPHS:-
VERTICES - basically nodes
EDGES - Lines that connect Vertex
Neighbors - Which all vertext can we reach

TYPES OF GRAPHS:-
Weighted
Directed

SORTING A GRAPH:-
ADJACENCY LIST(LIST OF LIST):=
graph size=total number of vertex
Eg: 0-2(-3-)-1
vertex wise[list of List]
   src destination
0 - {0,2}
1 - {1,2}{1,3}
2 - {2,0}{2,1}{2,3}
3 - {3,1}{3,2}
we can make of:=
Arraylist of Arraylist
hashmap
array of arraylist

ADJACENCY MATRIX
EDGE LIST
2D MATRIX(IMPLICIT GRAPH)
